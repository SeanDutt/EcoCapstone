    <h1>Eco Compete</h1>
    <span>Eco Compete is a social media platform designed to help users track their daily CO2 footprint, specifically that which comes from eating commercially available food.</span><br><br>
    <span>It's important to find ways to reduce our CO2 output because it is a huge factor in climate change.</span><br><br>
    <span>A quote from NASA's website:</span><br>
    <span>"Carbon dioxide (CO2). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 48% since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived 'forcing' of climate change."</span>

    <h2>Check-ins</h2>
    <span>The main function of the site is for users to create and compare daily checkins. After creating an account, users are able to submit daily check-ins by entering roughly how many servings of various food items they prepared that day. After submitting a check-in, users are given an estimate of how much Co2 they were responsible for that day, shown as their score.</span>

    <h2>Profile page</h2>
    <span>On a user's profile page, they'll be able to see how other users in their ZIP, continent, and income level have scored that day, and compare their score to those of their peers. Users are also able to enter a user and compare their check-in history to that user's directly.</span>
