# <b>Eco Compete</b>
A daily check-in app that tracks your carbon footprint, helps encourage earth-friendly habits, tracks and displays personal progress using graphs, and shows you how you're doing in comparison to other users in your community, country, or anywhere in the world.

<br>

# Milestone 1
- Takes user input on things like miles driven, commercial meat/produce consumed, and other daily tasks that impact the earth, and returns an eco score relating to input given.

<br>

# Milestone 2
- Users can create profiles storing information like their car's MPG, their country, ZIP code, income level, and other variables that can affect your footprint. The scores you recieve from the daily check-in will be affected by these variables.

<br>

# Milestone 3
- Users will have access to a daily score graph, tracking their progress, giving tips, feedback, and encouraging the habits they're developing.

<br>

# Milestone 4
- Users will be able to look up other profiles, see their daily score graph, their non-private information, and compare their graph to their own.

<br>

# Milestone 5
- A leaderboard of user's scores. Sortable by ZIP, country, planet. Can also be broken down into 28-day scoreboard, weekly, and daily. 28-day would be the most important for me, personally, as that is the time it takes to develop a habit.
